# my past project experience

create session worker

delete session worker

garbage collection worker


# batch processing

go routine batched sorting

MapReduce

application: 
word count
reverse index for doc


# stream processing

data unbounded

faster, real-time

event time vs processing time: (task create time and task deque time)

stream pipeline is down: a lot of unprocessed stream tasks

batch size in stream processing: redis 



# lambda architecture
use stream and batch at the same time


## kafka

message queue has retention

## RabbitMQ

pub/sub no data retention


## custom implemented queue
max priority queue
in-memory fifo queue
data base with priority as index
